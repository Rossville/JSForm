# JSForm

This form is built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It can save data in the localStorage so that the progress of the form is not deleted by the form is closed by any mistake.

Apart from that I tried implementing the some transitions in the input field as well.

I've also added a status/progress window here user can get to know which page, they're currently at.
